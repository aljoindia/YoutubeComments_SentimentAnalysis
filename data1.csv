Theresa Musser,"I have been following the Lord Jesus Christ for many years now. I have watched “The Robe”, “Ben Hur”, “The Greatest Story Ever Told”, “Risen”, “The Road to Emmaus”, and so many “Christian” movies and shows over the last 60+ years of my life. All of them had glitches, or flaws or maybe slightly different interpretations than I had. Many of them were good and edifying, some were, maybe lacking. I have also read and seen historical novels that were great, and some not so great. I love the Lord and only want to serve him. I have always enjoyed good books and shows that have value. I have been involved in theatrical productions during school and at my church over the years. I think those things have been good. While the Chosen is not perfect I have found much of it to be very edifying and none of it thus far, to be blasphemous. Some parts are definitely better than others. I express my concerns about things that are odd or peculiar with family & friends. I know my Bible and I will continue to study it and proclaim it. The Chosen is a TV show trying to show forth the life of Jesus and His apostles. It is flawed, yes, but it is pretty good. Many people would never pick up a Bible or give Jesus a thought, however, many people might watch this show and begin to think about Jesus, start to ask questions about Jesus and start to read a Bible after seeing this show. 
Yes people need to know and understand that this is historical and Christian fiction. It is not the word for word script of the Bible, nor does it claim to be. If people feel that it is a distraction for them from God and His word then they should not watch it. I have found it to have the opposite effect on people, drawing them to Christ and the gospel. 
We are all different. If it doesn’t edify you, then leave it and pray for the souls that do watch it.",Against,YOBAH,159,7 replies,8 months ago

Joshua,"I have to say. I watched the chosen when I was sort of in a years long dry spell and it sparked an interest in me to start reading the Bible again. 

Seeing the scenes and the background, the people, the way they dressed and how they lived sort of gives me a better view of what it might have looked like to be there for real! 

Of course I had concerns about some scenes and some things that Jesus said and Dallas has been very open to the fact that they are not claiming he did say this but merely he might have said this and I share your concern with that issue. I don’t like putting words into Gods mouth either but all of that being said I don’t think the show is horrible and I like watching it time to time but nothing beats the Bible period! 

And I will say that God may have used that show to get me back into his word. Since then I’ve read the entire Bible and I read/listen to the Audio everyday of the Bible and my spiritual walk has gone in a great direction!

Mad Jackie,"The Jesus I fell in love with was in the movie ""Jesus of Nazareth."" He was portrayed as calm, kind, tender, loving, caring, and peaceful-all of which He is. However, He is much much more than that. I have struggled getting to know Christ as He is because I have clung so tightly to the Jesus I first loved. The Lord has helped me to understand why I was drawn to Him in that movie, but has also helped me to see how my desire to see Him as only that way has blinded me from seeing Him as He fully is. And He had to open my eyes to how blind I'd been too because I didn't even know I was blind.

There is a reason the Lord commanded:

3 ""You shall have no other gods before me.  4 ""You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.  (Exodus 20:3-4, ESV)

Rebecca Otis,"Todd, thank you for your words of caution.  I believe that your words can apply to any Christian media, not just The Chosen.  It is very easy for us to let our guards down when something is slapped with a label that says ""Christian"", whether that be movies, tv shows, music, or books.  I started watching The Chosen when the second season came out and have really enjoyed it so far.  I have not agreed with all of the choices that they have made (for example, the background story of Mary Magdalene)  but I have still enjoyed it.  It is a Christian artistic endeavor that has surprisingly been VERY well produced and well acted, something that I wish was more the norm instead of the mediocrity (at best) that we typically get.

Lilac Daisy,"I found out about this show when looking for Country-music Christian songs and heard ""The Woman at the Well."" It was such a beautiful scene, I looked it up, to see what they were saying. It made me cry. And then I felt guilty for being so moved by a fictional Jesus. Soon, I heard someone say that God chose to reveal himself through WORDS alone. Not plays, not images, not even statues of images. That really hits home when I read about Jesus being made THE Word, and that we're the only created being that uses words. 

It's extraordinary.

Will Bay,"Thanks Todd Friel for the warning about some of the influences behind The Chosen. I will take them on board. I can honestly say that I have never been as excited by The Chosen as The Bible & visiting Israel & meeting Jews, Messianic Jews & Christians there. I still think that The Chosen is an incredible project though, that has been instrumental in introducing many people to Jesus & persuading them to go & open a Bible. It has Blessed me & been a reminder of just how Jewish Jesus & the Bible is. I find it so sad & frustrating that so many Christian Churches I have worshipped in are beautifully steeped in God's Word but have so little interest in or understanding of the Jewish context of it or God's enduring relationship with The Jews as well as us Gentiles.
Todd, doesn't it feel odd to be quite rightly proclaiming that The Bible alone is sufficient to learn about Jesus & how to be saved from Sin, be made right with Our Creator - God Almighty, Jesus' Father, who sent us The Holy Spirit &  offers us Eternal Life; and then advertise a book you have written about Jesus? It may be very scholarly & well meaning but does Jesus really need 'Unmasking'? I don't get it??

Melissa D.,"I watched The Chosen. I really liked it. I do know parts are fiction but other parts are straight out of scripture.  My first thought after listening to Todd's commentary is The Chosen is no different than The Ten Commandments, Greatest Story Ever Told, or any other of the great movies based on Biblical history.  If a movie causes just one soul to start searching for the real Jesus, why is that wrong? Mark 9:38-40
""38 - John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.”  39 - But Jesus said, “Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. 40 - For the one who is not against us is for us.""",Against,,66,54 replies,8 months ago
me_3189,"Before I watch this video, I want to give my personal perspective on the Chosen.

I LOVE(ed) it.

Through tears, laughter, heart feel’zee good’zees I watched each episode multiple times and cried at all the same spots.

BUT

but…but….but….but….
I developed a bad taste in my mouth after tuning in to some of the videos where Dallas was interviewing the actors.

I soon, almost immediately had an “I don’t like this” feeling.

The actors have been put onto celebrity pedestals instead of being like John the Baptist and shrinking into the background.

I could even look past the multi religious beliefs of the cast IF Dallas had made a public profession of his desire to evangelize them and lead them to the True Jesus.

Lastly…while I enjoyed very much each beautiful moment as portrayed in the show….I cannot get past the blatant need for Dallas and team to “be like the world” and conform.

It does sadden me because I feel that had he made that part of his mission statement and not just to “make people love Jesus”, perhaps his mission would taste better.

Thank God for His word and my Spirit provoked desire to KNOW and LOVE my Savior.

Anthony Tan,"As a fan of The Chosen, I must admit that my guards went up when while watching this video. I have rebuttals ready for all points mentioned in this video and so much more. I've also read the comments that had concerns about watching The Chosen and I have replies for each one that I read so far.

I want to really have an open mind to the concerns and I'm still trying to understand but I am really having a hard time doing that because it goes against my biases. Cognitive dissonance I think is what it's called.

Having said all these, I feel I owe it to those who have a chance to read this comment to explain why I don't fundamentally agree with some of the claims this video made.

1. Theology: Regarding the other influences. The mormon producers have zero influence on the theology being shown in the series. The Jesus shown in the series is not a created being. The series does not teach a works-based salvation. There are no Roman Catholic theology in the episodes. The reason Mormons and Catholics are not offended by The Chosen is not because The Chosen agrees with their theology...but rather, the exclusive theologies of Roman Catholicism and Mormonism are yet to be explored (3 seasons as of this comment). Although I've seen some comments expressed by some Catholics that found offense on Mother Mary's depiction of suffering in labour for baby Jesus. From what I've seen, the only influence the Catholic Priest ever had was to make sure any depictions of Mary would be palatable to the Catholic viewers but The Chosen has not went out of its way to show a Divine Mary 3 seasons so far. I would say that the biggest influence in The Chosen is the Messianic Rabbi. Jewish prayers, customs, traditions, festivals, places, outfit, I have never seen a Jesus show that has embraced the Jewishness of the bible more than The Chosen.

2. Sufficiency: If you watch The Chosen because it helps you to learn about Jesus more, that means that the show is doing its job as a Christian TV show. If you watch the show because it helps you love Jesus more, then the show is doing its job as a Christian TV show. But if you watch The Chosen and you're not learning about the biblical Yeshua and you're not growing in love with the biblical Yeshua, then by all means, avoid watching it. A Christian TV show can only do so much. But to say that The Chosen conflicts with Sola Scriptura is a stretch. The creative liberties of the show are not comparable to the apocryphal books. The rhetorical goals of the 66 books of the bible are not altered in The Chosen. The show never claimed to be a replacement and infact acknowledges the creative liberty. It would be wrong to use The Chosen as a bible replacement in the same way that it would be wrong for Christian books to be a bible replacement. A pastor should point you back to God and His Word. Christian books and bible commentaries should point you back to God and His Word. That's what The Chosen aims to do from a TV show medium...and this is what I think people would be missing out on and what fans of the show are enjoying.

3. Blasphemy: The statements offered in this 3rd point presupposes that The Chosen has altered the rhetorical goals of the bible and presupposes that it has presented itself as a replacement for God's Word. It also presupposes that the show has been influenced by Mormon and Catholic theology. But it has not.

Having said these counter arguments, I do agree with the three questions at the end...that we should ask these questions when we're about to try something new in general. And I've also added some further questions on each:

1. Did Jesus really say that? If He didn't, does it still agree harmoniously with the bible?

2. Am I in danger of believing apocryphal literature or media about Jesus?

3. Is there a reason any Christian media moves me when the bible does not? Could this possibly be a heart issue that I just happen to project upon the media?

Should you watch the show? Only if you understand its intended purpose.

If you will watch the show, please watch it through the lens of The Bible; Don't read the bible through the lens of the show.",Against,,2,6 replies,2 months ago

I read Bible, still reading.
And i know that, In The Chosen's script all the things are not the exactly the same that Jesus said. I know that in the last of revelation, written like don't add or don't take away anything from this Book (BIBLE). 
, The Chosen's director also said this is not the exact things that Jesus said/did many things in it are created by him, but i  think that show is really helpful to sooo many ppl that who don't know Christ. New developments, new idea of spreading Jesus's words- i thinking it like that. Nobody can erase my Love for Jesus by doing a show like that. it increasing day by day. 
Soo many non-believers are came to Christ bcoz of The Chosen' show. I saw a comment like a viewer was going to suiçídîng but after seeing The Chosen', he/she changed mind and came to Christ.
I think The Chosen is a very effective platform to call the non believers to Christ and the Christians to love Jesus and everyone more. John the apostle 21: 5 Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.
There are so many things that Jesus did.But we know that may not be the same things that we can see in The Chosen. But every person who see The Chosen can't resist Jesus's love. They can see the mercy of Jesus over  judgement. “I desire mercy, not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” this is what Jesus said. Everyone who see The Chosen will come to Christ I'm sure, thereby in the name of their love towards Jesus will make them read the Bible. Thereby they'll get more and more close to Jesus our Lord. By that they'll live a life w/ kindness and peace and more than anything, they all learn to forgive like Jesus forgive us. ️

So,the point is, i know that the chosen is not the exact same the things Jesus did, but this show shows the UNFAILING LOVE OF JESUS TOWARDS US. HIS LOVE WILL NEVER CHANGE ️. HE IS THE SAME GOD ",Against,,3,,5 months ago

1211foster,"I became concerned when I watched some of the behind the scenes and writers' videos they put out.
Just a bit of content that are red flags:
-Jesus dictating, rehearsing, and taking suggestions from his disciple while ""prepping"" his Sermon on the Mt.
-The slander of Peter, who is our brother whom we will get to know in heaven. It's implied that he had been adulterous, that he betrayed his fellow Jews, among other things.
-The statement that the word of God won't be completely written, that it can be added to. The writers actually chuckled at how pleased Mormon ""Christians"" were with that scene.
-Changing actual facts (ex. writing in a female as the main instigator of bringing the paralytic to Jesus. I'm female and I know pandering when I see it.)

Another and probably the biggest thing is that for youngster and sometimes not youngster they SHOULD NOT substitute reading the bible with watching this show, this goes for ANY Christian show for that matter. This is purely entertainment and supplementation to reading the Word. The show to me brings out the words and shows me the side I never thought about and that was of the disciples, it tends to put me in their seat and how I ""think"" I would have perceived it.

Faith is not a emotion let me make that clear firstly, however seeing certain miracles performed on show as I know the Words from the Bible it spoke volumes to me and just made me Love Jesus even more. a Great example is the lame man who was sleeping next to the pool. I was crying big manly tears of joy! Also the woman at the well, just wow. Reading that and seeing it in such context just burns fire in my heart. I mean Jesus did that, He loves us so.

Reclaiming the Prophetic Mantle,"Having studied the Gospels, especially Mathew's Gospel from a 1st-century historical and cultural perspective, I initially found The Chosen intriguing and insightful. I could accept the plausibility perspective portrayed by The Chosen but there were some episodes that I drew the line, the chief being the final episode of Season 2. The scene presented Jesus as a ""rock star"" with a stage being built, hand bills being passed out, and women backstage suggesting what apparel Jesus should wear. The Scene is the Sermon on the Mount and Jesus' ""stage"", according to Matthew 5:1, was Jesus sitting down on mountainside. The depiction went far aside from plausibility, especially when the explanation for the stage was attributed to the manner in which Philip was cast as an architect and the state idea was to give Philip an opportunity to contribute to the story. There were other ""stretches"" regarding plausibility, but this just went too far. Perhaps the intent of creating more interest in Jesus and the Gospels is noble, but The Chosen's plausibility creates a deniability. I liked Jesus' ""Get used to being different"" and purchased the T-shirt, but if different distorts the message, then perhaps it is time to reevaluate the premise of plausibility and allow the Scriptures to speak for themselves without interjecting Post-Modern entertainment values.",For,,"

Where my issue arises is all of the filler stuff that happens inbetween. All the adding to what the disciples did, what Christ did or said just becomes an eyeroll and strays from biblical accuracy. Which is what I wanted to see from the show in the first place. The first season had so much from the Bible with some filler for the gaps. Then the second season had some great biblical moments with more filler for the gaps. Come season 3, it felt like it was reduced down to just a few biblical moments with a WHOLE BUNCH of made up filler for the sake of run time. I slowly lost interest in the show",For,,"

Joseph Hession,"I would also like to point out that when we read the Bible we are reading translations. These translations try to be faithful to what Jesus said, but there is quite a lot of art and science behind it, and let us be honest, there are myriads of difficult decision points in choosing one meaning or sense to the words over another when constructing an English (or other language) equivalent. In a related way, when a show like the Chosen shows an emotion on Jesus' face in some situation, they are making an informed decision, but still an imperfect guess at what emotion Jesus would have had in that moment. Who here can say with a straight face that when you read the words of Christ in your private Bible reading time you read them so woodenly as to have no conception or guess with how He is speaking those words? Who then could disagree that others who have good Biblical knowledge cannot help us interpret the manner or emotion that particular words may have been spoken so as to deepen our understanding of a passage. Aren't the emotions behind the words being said relevant to the meaning of the words themselves? As an aside, I am curious what this podcaster might think of ""The Gospel of John"" movie. It certainly resolves some of the major concerns by being a straight reading of an English translation of the Bible, but it is still set to locations and situations and facial expressions and intonations, etc..., so really, it has most of the same ""problems.""",Against,,"

I do think we all have imagined what it was like for the apostles to live and travel with Jesus and what it will be like to live and be in in His presence.

It would be great to see Todd et al create a show/movie/documentary with an all evangelical production team, cast and crew that depicts Jesus' life as per the Bible with no additions or nuances.

Yet, we (flawed human beings) are limited when attempting to depict this on film. 

The goal should be to point believers and non-believers to the Bible to dig deeper into the truth of salvation in Christ and I think the Chosen is doing that.

Sombra,"I have not watched The Chosen nor really had much inclination to do so. I had read early on about some theological concerns some Bible believing academics and teachers had about the series. I grew up in one of the Protestant denominations. I don’t necessarily have animosity toward the Roman Catholic faith because I’ve met RC believers who did strongly appear to value and demonstrate faith over works. There are a lot of Protestant church members who don’t “get it” either. And there are people following the Mormon faith who are really decent folks. Nevertheless, I do not wish to allow that their concept of Jesus has any merit. Pluto TV is running the Russell Crowe movie, Noah, right now and it’s sad to realize that many people with short attention spans and not tolerance for reading anything beyond a social media app will believe it, or rank it up there with comic-to-big screen book U-verse theology. One thing that people who are seeking truth or entertainment need to understand is that the Lord Jesus was fully God as well as being 100 percent man. While he laid aside his deity to be one of us, he never parted from it and was always a commanding presence, even when his human shell was beaten down and most vulnerable- even unto death. Any book or media production that tries to portray the “human” Jesus and fails to depict that characteristic is nothing but fiction and should be rated as such. Is it possible for God to use poor quality testaments such as these to point the Way to the truth - yes, but we shouldn’t jump on every bandwagon. It’s better to go to the root - the Scriptures.",For,,"

Robin Doe,"I very much enjoyed both seasons of The Chosen.  As a believer and follower of Christ,  I will admit it opened my imagination to what life may have been like when Jesus walked the earth.  I have kept in mind however that this is entertainment and not scripturally accurate.  I don't care for some of the story lines and back stories Dallas poses however I still find it fascinating to picture the culture and times of Jesus.  As all of us that are followers of the Way, we long to meet Jesus and see Him face to face.  I would be lying if I didn't say I was moved to tears during the encounter on the rooftop when Jesus is talking with Nicodemus regarding the requirements to become a follower and be saved, as well as Jesus first encounter with Mary.  It was humbling to see Nicodemus fall to his knees in tears in the presence of Jesus, as I think most of us would. It's like the Mercy Me song, when Bart sings about how he will react when he meets Jesus face to face, ""or will I fall to my knees, will I sing hallelujah will I be able to speak at all, I can only imagine"". I believe it is the to see Jesus and perhaps glimpse His life that draws people to The Chosen.  Having said that, I notice there are many people who are beginning to ""worship"" the actor who plays Jesus, Jonathan Roumie.  I believe he is doing an excellent job portraying Jesus but he is just a man.  I've also noticed the hype and almost cult behavior around those who watch/follow The Chosen.  I will watch the series to it's completion with the perspective that this entertainment.  I know the Truth and I believe every word in the Bible.  As this is a production for entertainment, the actors, producers and directors will take liberties that have nothing to do with scripture as we have seen already.  I feel it is okay to watch the series as long as you know truth from fiction and have discernment.

Dallas Jenkins wants to be a famous director/producer.  He has made that known since the beginning of The Chosen when he discusses his crushing failure in Hollywood.  I hope this does not come across as judgmental but I have noticed Dallas has a very faithful following now and it seems that he is losing perspective/focus for the reason he created The Chosen.  He is gaining the fame and notoriety he always wanted.  I pray this does not change his focus. It may already be too late as I see he surrounds himself with famous ""Christian"" musicians that are more secular than true followers.  It is a very slippery slope and those who do not know the true Word can be easily drawn into the new age Christian movement.",Against,,"

I’m sure the goal of the show is to be faithful to Scripture and provide a high quality piece of art that people can watch in their free time other than the plethora of unedifying art available. Is God glorified in the making of this show? I would say yes when they are faithful to the words and tone of Scripture. I believe Dallas says its not a replacement for reading your bible and that shouldn’t even need to be said. I think the problem could lay with Christians not being solid in biblical knowledge and their faith, and not the art itself. I’ve watched each episode once and the show has a few things I’m not thrilled about, but I’ve found some moments spot on and quite edifying, which would be another question: is it edifying? And that would be a question for each individual. Someone could say “just read your bible,” which is true, but I think it misses the point of art. I wish they would make more narrative connections from the OT, they’ve made a few and done a good job, but there’s more room for adding biblical theology and other nuance.",Against,,7,3 replies,8 months ago

Went to various other people as well.  He then leads from the Bible.  I have watched this show many times now and I watched it through the entire first season before I watched it with my wife.  Then I watched it with my children.  I am exceedingly careful to ensure false teachings don't slip through.

I evangelize to Mormons, so I am very familiar with their doctrines, etc - and am very watchful.  I hear you Todd, but please judge the content directly.

My ultimate goal for the Christian movie industry is to film something similar to Prince of Egypt, which had amazing animation, songs, and a fantastic storyline and for people to show their God-given talents in the movie industry and stop settling for awful Christian movies. Though I don't think Chosen is really Christian, I applaud that they're actually producing a good series (I mean with the lighting, the music, the characters, etc).

However, for some reason, I felt a little uncomfortable with it. The support for this show was /is almost cult-like. So...I did some research on who was behind making this series.  Then I started hearing the comments made by Jenkins.  That is what made me stop watching this fictionalized story of Jesus. Can it spark an interest from an unbeliever? Possibly. But it also may lead them down a wrong path after that interest is sparked.

We do not worship the same Jesus as mormons or for that matter...even catholics. Do some research on this topic. What you will find will show how preposterous Dallas Jenkins is with his comments.  Since the mormons are producing this show with Jenkins and that the producers make the money.

Given_Grace,"I enjoyed the Chosen immensely. However they did add a lot of things that are just not in the gospels that are nice from a watching point of view but definitely not theological or biblical. I'm thinking of Thomas and Ramah,  Matthews autism and secret love for Mary, Nathanael's despair underneath the fig tree etc.

I understand that it was never intended to be a verse by verse reproduction of the gospel but far too much was included for artistic interpretation. Many of the miracles happened at inconsistent times not keeping to the record in the gospels. People might say ""hey, what's the harm"" but the harm is in that they weren't just miracles Jesus did but every single one was done, at a certain place and time for a certain reason.

It'll also be confusing to the reader of a Bible when things don't happen the same, what I mean by this is that it's lovely many new people are getting into the Bible because of the chosen however if they don't understand the chosen is just a TV show then they might struggle where the Bible tells a very different story.

OzzyB,"I disagree with your take on this to an extent. 
I’ve watched the Chosen. I’ve been saved for 7-8 years now give it take. Have spent a lot of time in theology and apologetics. 
The Chosen is inspired by the Bible and the “what would Jesus do” mentality. If we really want to get logistical and to the T we do not know every single word of every single minute that Jesus spoke. We get the Gospels and the recordings that the Apostles had with Jesus. But we don’t get a full 365 day account for each year of the day by day of Jesus’s 3 year ministry. 
Like if we wanna go that route we can. It’s not going to lead anywhere constructive. 
As far as the heart of the show it definitely stems from the biblical Jesus the compassion, the care, the steadfastness etc. it’s a depiction of course of what it would be like for us to witness Jesus. There have been many that have never known Christ that have come to know because of this show. Philippians 1:18 clearly speaks about how false teachers even use the word of God. If we through a show are sharing the personhood of Christ through a character played by someone who is not considered an evangelical or Protestant. Who cares. Is Jesus not being introduced to an audience that probably would have never cared? And if the crew consist of many different Christian’s who have different theological beliefs who cares? Are they not still helping lift up Christ. Whether they think it’s their depiction of Jesus or not. He’s clearly not being depicted as the Mormon Christ. But they’re doing their best to depict him as the biblical Christ. Not everything about the show will be “biblically accurate” for our Bible thumpers. 
I am aware and mature enough to know this is a show. Not everything is going to be script per script. Word per word like in the Bible. It’s clearly a show trying to depict how people are impacted by the sheer presence of Christ himself. That’s a good thing. 
So I can agree with you to an extent. But I wouldn’t tell someone to not watch this. Unless you have such glass convictions that you cannot consume any kind of media that doesn’t depict or talk about Christ word per word exactly how the Bible has it. 
I will say I appreciate the non English accents they have and the middle Easter like accents they carry because even tho it’s fictional they’re doing their best to depict the people of that time. 
All this to say. Can’t we just enjoy something good. Acknowledge that Christ is being lifted up regardless of the messenger and that who knows. Maybe through seeing this Show and working in this show those crew members believers and none believers may discover the true Christ ?

I think not, and that is what is so scary. People are seeing, absorbing, and seeking movie Jesus and not the real, living, biblical Jesus.

We start seeing them through the lens of the show not scripture. I’m still trying to get this actor’s face out of my head when I read Jesus. 

I’ve seen a clip of the apostles calling John the Baptist “crazy John” and even Jesus laughing at it!  That’s sinful, when Jesus said in Matt11:11 there is no one born of woman greater than John. He was the Elijah to come announcing the Messiah. Does anyone remember what happened to the 42 boys who were making fun of Elijah in 
1 Kings 2:23? He cursed them and two she bears came out and killed them. Sounds like making fun of God’s prophet is a deadly serious offense but not to Dallas Jenkins I guess.

I avoided watching the chosen up until a few months ago. I feel silly having avoided them and instead I rewatched The Office. I had no objective reason to not watch it I just didn’t feel like it. But like many others, I felt a strong pull to the Bible during and after watching. I began to talk so much more about what is actually in the Bible. I’ve engaged in very fruitful debates. I’ve only become more sanctified afterwards (not because of watching the chosen, but from reading His word). 

These comments I read about people being relieved to have avoided a show about Jesus because it is not the Bible verbatim and it contains extra-biblical details are hard to take serious knowing most people in most churches have TVs or smart phones and they don’t just use them for streaming sermons. I’m positive that most (85%+) people will be better after (not because of) watching the chosen instead of their usual screen time preferences, but this is not the affirmation they are looking for.

Geoff Noyes,"The big win for Mormons taking part in this production is both powerful and subtle.
Primarily because it includes them in the production of a major 'christian' movie produced by 'Christians' about the life of Jesus Christ, with no awkward portrayals about the book of Mormon or Joseph Smith.
Mormons have made great efforts particularly recently to align themselves with biblical Christianity, ie officially dropping the Mormon name and insisting on being called 'the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints'.
The Mormon Tabernacle choir have been re named for example.
They believe close proximity and assistance in this landmark production will enhance their acceptance amongst other churches as fellow christians.
The bizarre history and claims of Joseph Smith, and the inclusion of his writings being their holy scriptures (along with the Bible), have up to now usually excluded them from being considered a Bible believing church,
As has in particular the story in the book of Mormon.
This is a perception they are working hard to eliminate, being involved in the production of the chosen fits in perfectly with this goal.
Todd Friel has the discernment to understand this.

We Christians tend to tear apart movies or songs about Christ that don't fit our views. However, if the medium points to Christ and Him alone, we must be careful to rush and call it heretical or blasphemous. We also should look at these things through the lens of scripture to be able to discern which is truth, and which is creative licensing.

It's not meant to be an exegesis.  Dallas often reminds the viewers to read the Bible account and that the chosen does not replace God's word. I share your concern with Catholics and Mormons participating in the production, however. I think the verse that applies to that concern is being ""unequally yoked to unbelievers."" I'm sure some Catholics are believers and some Mormons are true believers, but the message that it may send to the unsaved is an equality of them to Biblical Christianity. Catholicism has its problematic issues and Mormonism is a false religion. In that I share your concern. May God continue to use this (The Chosen)  imperfect fictional account.",Against,,"

He certainly wasn't condoning man's traditions or participating in them.. he was the word embodied.. therefore he would have followed YHVH [God's] declared new year at Passover.

Elissa Bella J🌞Y,"I got saved when I was 12 and saw the ""Jesus Movie"" all by myself. Growing up in Communist and Socialist Eastern Europe I knew nothing about God, creation, Jesus. Yet watching this movie that for the sake of putting the message of the Bible into context put ""extra words"" in the mouth of Jesus, I understood I was a sinner and needed to be saved back to God. I repented and was brought from darkness into light. There is a certain amount of ""danger"" in creating Bible based entertainment, but there is also a huge blessing in putting God's Word into context. The same goes for teaching Bible studies. There is always a small chance that the teacher will not give the correct interpretation, yet if they are faithfully seeking God's guidance and the leading of the Spirit, they will teach the truth and be corrected when needed. 
Seeing Jesus and the disciples as human beings helps a LOT of people understand that is what they really were. The Chosen might end up being more misleading than we had hoped (I pray it doesn't)), but no movie and Bible study has brought the Apostles ""down to earth"" as much as this series. People must let go of the glories above the Apostles' heads and must stop thinking they walked a foot above the ground. The Church has done a poor job in teaching the Word on a level people understand it correctly. AND the Church has also done a terrible job of presenting Christ as a Jewish man, instead He comes across more like a Western white male. Both from teachings and movies. I attended Bible College when I was young, a good one, and learned a lot, but I have learned more about the Jewish culture in the 3.5 seasons than in my years at Bible College and in Church.

Merry Streeter,"Brother Todd, I see The Chosen as a fictional account and not a replacement for the Bible, whatsoever. I do see your points, but there are many who can separate truth from fiction. It's not meant to be an exegesis.  Dallas often reminds the viewers to read the Bible account and that The Chosen does not replace God's word. I share your concern with Catholics and Mormons participating in the production, however. I think the verse that applies to that concern is being ""unequally yoked to unbelievers."" I'm sure some Catholics are believers and some Mormons are true believers, but the message that it may send to the unsaved is an equality of them to Biblical Christianity. Catholicism has its problematic issues and Mormonism is a false religion. In that I share your concern. May God continue to use this (The Chosen)  imperfect fictional account.",Against,,"

kwpp7,"My biggest concern about The Chosen is the cultish mentality of its fans. It's definitely become a sacred cow you dare not touch. One wonders if they would defend the scriptures as vehemently as they defend the show. I enjoyed the first couple seasons but saw them in the same light as any other Bible genre movie that's come out over the years. Nothing more. Dallas' defense of Mormonism disturbs me, as did The Chosen's tasteless billboard advertisements in which Satan facetiously gives reasons to not watch the show (unwittingly highlighting all the positive results from doing so). It's meant as a sort of clickbait to get hostile nonbelievers to check out the show and I seriously despise pandering to the younger generation with such idiocy, as though they're incapable of serious thought.",For,,1,,5 months ago (edited)
Aragorn,"I was a staunch support of the show until around the middle of season two. Even had keyboard wars with people who didn’t like it. The first thing that turned me off was that Jesus had to memorize the sermon on the mount, which is against scripture. He was God, he did not need to memorize what he was going to say. That is almost an attack on His omniscience. Second, the disrespect that the character of John the Baptist showed towards our Lord was disgusting to say the least. This also is against scripture as John the Baptist worshipped our Lord and said that he was not even worthy to untie his sandals. Do you really think the REAL John would have tried to give “a little advice” to Jesus? No. Third, towards the end of the season, Jesus is asking Matthew (who is autistic in the show, which I think is ridiculous) what He should say in his Sermon on the mount. WHAT?! 

I think Dallas Jenkins is an arrogant person, as he refuses to listen to people who have concerns with who he is aligning by with, and with the theology displayed by the show. In fact, he tells people not to watch the show if they disagree with him! He is even quoted as saying “I don’t fully understand my faith. No one does.”. I fully understand what I believe about my Lord, and about sin. This is concerning, coming from the creator and director. If he is saved, he is VERY spiritually immature and needs to stop making the show and be discipiled by REAL theologians like JMac. The gospel has not been preached at all as of season 2. Season one is fine, but season 2 is borderline blasphemous. Stay away and just read the Bible or watch pretty much any of the Jesus films made available on YT. Peace.",For,,1,,8 months ago

"Allen Skidmore, the Oneness Jesus Man","I come to exalt the Holy Name of Jesus Christ, the Name above every name! 

God has highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is above every name! (Philippians 2:9), that at the name of JESUS every knee should bow, in heaven, and in the earth, and under the earth (Philippians 2:10), and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is LORD, to the glory of God the Father! (Philippians 2:11)

God alone spreads out the heavens, And treads on the waves of the sea! (Job 9:8)


See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. (Colossians 2:8) For in HIM dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. (Colossians 2:9) And you are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power. (Colossians 2:10) He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn all of creation. (Colossians 1:15) In Him were all things created, that are in heaven, that are in the earth; visible and invisible, whether they're thrones or dominions or principalities or powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him. (Colossians 1:16) He is before all things, and by Him all things consist. (Colossians 1:17.) And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. (Colossians 1:18) For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell. (Colossians 1:19.) 

He is the Divine Word, the Divine Logos, which is God and was from the beginning (John 1:1), made flesh, and He dwelt among us, amen! (John 1:14.) He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. (John 1:10.) To them that believe on His name, (JESUS,) to them He gave the power to become the sons of God. Amen! (John 1:12.)

He is one with the Father (John 10:30,) and anyone who has seen Jesus has seen the Father (John 14:8-11.) He is the way, the truth, and the life, and no man can come to the Father except through Jesus! (John 14:6) Jesus Christ is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, the Lord of lords (1 Timothy 6:15.) who only has immortality, dwelling in light which no man can approach unto, to Him be honor and power everlasting. Amen! (1 Timothy 6:16.)

He is the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last! (Revelation 1:11.) There is salvation in no other, for there is no other name under heaven given to us men, whereby we must be saved! (Acts 4:12) And to those who receive Him, those who believe on His name, to them gave He power to become sons of God. (John 1:12.) Whoever denies the Son, the same doesn't have the Father, but he that acknowledges the Son, has the Father also! (1 John 2:23)

All people everywhere: Honor the Son,  as You honor the Father! (John 5:23.) Kiss the Son, lest He be angry. (Psalm 2:12.) If any person does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let them be accursed. Come soon Lord Jesus! (1 Corinthians 16:22.)

Benjamin Albanese,"""How would you feel if someone wrote a fictional story about what you might have said?""
It depends. Is it someone I really might have said? I agree it's tricky, but I think the difference between the chosen and other gospel reenactments is that since it is made by Christians, it is made by people who really know Jesus to some significant degree. Actually, I have been written into stories before and I've felt complimented by my portrayal. One thing I like about the Chosen is that while I know it isn't all in the Bible, it is something that COULD have happened. 

 Your critique about Catholics and Mormons being involved in the chosen shows some ignorance, at least with regard to Catholicism. Catholicism isn't works based. It's grace based, hence the cross and the sacraments which dispense grace. Good works are involved and play a role in justifying you (James 2:4, Romans 2:13) but our salvation isn't works based. That claim just shows you don't know what the Church teaches, and that means you shouldn't be talking about it. Also I, can't speak for Mormons, but as for us Catholics, biblical Jesus doesn't offend us because He didn't teach Protestant doctrines, which is why the chosen doesn't offend us. As of yet, I haven't seen it deviate from what is possible. .

Also as for the ""apocryphal books"" I hate to tell you this, but the early Church didn't largely reject them, at least not any more than they did other books such as 2 Peter, Revelation, and some other OT books you accept. The early Church had no uniform biblical canon (which disproves the antibiblical doctrine of Sola Scriptura) until the Council of Carthage and Rome. And guess what, those councils included the same 73 books the Catholic Church uses.",Against,,"

nute7,"Mormons do believe in the ""same Jesus"". I think many times what they believe are ""misunderstood"" by those that don't dig a little deeper and really study their beliefs (vs just based on speculation or what they've heard from others).  Jesus was our elder spirit brother (and God) was our father.  He was first in ""spirit"" then came to the earth in flesh (so he could be with us, teach us, save us on the cross and then was resurrected). Mormons do believe in both ""Grace"" but also ""works. These are two ""different"" concepts often mistaken for each other (when they are indeed ""separate). Many people get these concepts mixed up.  Grace is free gift,  and everyone will receive it and be resurrected because Christ overcame sin and death (regardless of their actions being good or bad, so no work required!). However ""Exhalation"" is based on works (remember the scripture - ""faith without works is dead""?) Yeah - that means you have to try your ""best"". These are 2 ""similar"" but often confused with each other concepts.  I like the Chosen, because Jesus focused on the ""spirit of the law"" vs the ""letter: of the law (the Pharisees and Sadducees) focused mostly on . He (Jesus) said His father (God) what really wants is what's in our ""hearts"" (vs the letter). Jesus is the ""Law"". So I like what the creator of the chosen said ""We should be focused on Him(Jesus) more than just the Bible"" He (Jesus) is higher than the Law (because He is the Law / Word). This is what Jesus was trying to teach the people! Man wasn't made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath was for man. Now as  per ""authority"" in determining what the scriptures mean, it seems every sect, christian religion has their own take on it (in various degrees). So one might then just read and ask God themselves to see what is true (which is what the apostle James said to do).  The ""Light"" of Christ is universal, so anyone watching or hearing or reading things can be enlightened and know what is true (through the Holy Spirit) individually speaking.

For example the actor of Jesus. If you look at the ""we invited 9 gen-zers to watch the chosen"", he tells them about his own personal story of Jesus working in his life. You cant tell me that because he's catholic, that Jesus would reject him and not show himself to them as the true savior.

Truth Seeker,"My biggest problem with the Chosen 

- Trying to fill in blanks in the Bible that don’t need to be filled in. Whether it’s scenes that are nowhere in scripture but in a way contradict it. Giving characters backstories that aren’t known in the Bible. 

- Unbiblical Jesus. The show tries to make Jesus more “likable” for secular audiences I guess but it comes off as inauthentic and unbiblical. There’s scenes where Jesus says things he otherwise wouldn’t in the Bible (or simply hasn’t). Jesus is shown rehearsing for the sermon on the mount bc he doesn’t know what to say. Jesus in the Bible said not to worry about what to say(Matt 10:19/Jn 14:10). Jesus in the show barely talks about repentance or about the wages of sin. Jesus in scripture gave people some tough pills to swallow. He didn’t tell people what they wanted to hear but needed to.

-It’s an inaccurate representation of the Gospel. This just sums up all my points I guess but the show is not a faithful adaptation of the gospels. Many things Jesus said in the gospels I was eager to hear him say but the chosen Jesus didn’t say them. I’d wonder to myself “why couldn’t they follow this scene just as it is in scripture?” There’s even a short feature the chosen put out about Simeon from Luke 2:25-35. In scripture Simeon meets Jesus in the temple when he’s a baby to be presented. It’s a beautiful passage. The show completely changes it to have Simeon meet Jesus the night of his birth and they left out great things said by Simeon (verse 29-32 & 34). This may seem like a minute thing to complain about but it represents what this show is doing as a whole. It’s twisting scripture and not accurately adapting it.",For,,"

Michael Ship,"Interestingly, I donate to both Wretched and The Chosen.  Two entirely different ways that spread the Truth.

I have to say that what Todd offers is not wrong.  However, I do not think his criticisms are, if you will, sufficient.

Between the content of The Chosen and their Satan-based marketing arm, I think they are being relevant and doctrinal.  I submit that the criticism of adding, what Dallas calls ""plausible"" additions to dialog is no different than any other movie based on God or Jesus.  If there were something in The Chosen that was antithetical to the Word or even implausible, I would be less supportive of the production.

Dallas is wrong about Mormons worshipping the same Jesus.  True enough.  However, I have yet to find anything that smacks of uniquely LDS teachings that is in contravention with what is in scripture.  If you have something, I am happy to reconsider my view.

I think it boils down to Mark 9.  If others are doing in the name of Christ works that are beneficial to mankind, even if they are not part of the super special group, we should encourage them and lift them high and thank them for their contributions to His kingdom.

Adam Richardson,"I really appreciate Todd's point on the show putting words into the mouth of Jesus and that being blasphemy. 

To be honest I don't care much if a show makes general assumptions and educated guesses on Biblical people such as the disciples, Moses, Noah, etc. They are human and their actions aren't perfect and making up things they might have said and personalities for them I wouldn't think was blasphemous and wouldn't detract from scripture necessarily, unless they were actually going against scripture. 

However when it's done to Jesus it cannot be appropriate. He is literally God and everything he says is absolute truth and it's insane to make things up and treat him like any regular person when writing his character. As many have said the show has made Jesus more relatable and and made them more open to learning more. But we as believers and humans haven't been given permission by God to do such a thing. In fact we have been expressly told to  We have only been given his word to understand him and that is enough. 

And Jenkins being so lax on Mormons and Roman Catholics is seriously concerning. Eventually this show will mess up and have outright heresy or it will offend haters of God as it should. I think they plan on 7 seasons so it is bound to show its true colors. At that point true Christians who are defending the show now will see the truth. Jesus was hated in his time. 

To be clear I am well aware the show can and is being used by God for his plan, but everything is used by God. We aren't talking about the effectiveness at all.",For,,"

We don’t know everything about Jesus, not everything about Him was revealed in the Bible, so we would do well to not be so unbelievably close minded.

Its the same as listening to your pastor (or a TV minister) and not checking the scripture to see if they are teaching accurately. But I have to wonder if some are blowing this out of proportion? Its a TV show, not a replacement for scripture. Where were the complaints about The Shack or that other piece of garbage Noah with Russell Crow? No one complained about Jesus of Nazareth yet. It was directed by a homosexual. I think that we should be very vigilant about being true to the scripture. And if there are truly some theological errors in the Chosen, it is best to explain them so the rest of us can understand, then step away from watching it.

The producers cared more about money, and fame just like the typical Hollywood. They could not just leave Jesus's words the way they were. Instead, they added words to his mouth because they obviously didn't think His words were good enough to captivate people. What other reason would there be? This shows lack of faith, love and respect. This part bothered me too much, to continue watching.

I would love two see The Chosen  ditch the LDS all together, but God is using them to support the cast and production.

Non of the Mormons involved have any say on the dialogue and w/S3 there’s a new app not tied w/the LDS church we can all use.

Pray for them to get out and come to the true Christ of History and the Bible imagine how they will be when on that day they realize how they gave all their money to help with this series yet when we have tried to help them grasp their God is not our God they cried foul and we don’t understand their teaching.

Richard Henry,"I like the first season, and the second season was okay. I've looked at it further and had issue with the Mormon influence and Roman catholicism. Mormon's hands down are not christian. It is a polytheistic religion. Roman Catholics I believe can be saved, though not through their own system. But rather through Christ alone I've had many conversations with faithful Roman Catholics who would say that.

I don't think this is a breaking of the second commandment sort of thing or being even blasphemous necessarily unless it is blasphemous. These are things that could have been said. But it also wanders into the possibilities that are endless, which then leads us to all sorts of speculation.

We are visual people and I think this is a good help or can be to help people see the Bible alive. Reading versus watching TV of any stripe any book any content is going to be more difficult than watching. People don't like to do work. We've never really liked to do work. Since the fall. So I don't think it's a, oh The chosen is better than the Bible mentality, but rather it's visual auditory and it takes less effort than reading. I agree that the Bible is sufficient. And certainly should be read, and if you do watch The chosen be very wary overall of many things",Against,,"

We'd just toss them a Bible and say nothing, or just purely quote from the Bible without adding any stories, testimonies, and ways of explaining that are not direct quotes from the Bible. What about Creation? That is not the Bible, yet it adds to our faith, love, and worship of God. In summary, saying the Bible is sufficient cannot mean other things should not enrich our faith (e.g. enjoying God's creation).

The early church did NOT reject almost all of those books on the list he gave, in fact they considered almost all of them the same as any other book in the bible. Except for a few sole individuals around the early 4th century, they were always accepted until sometime AFTER the Reformation. Whether someone today wants to do the same is a completely different topic. But the fact is, the early church did accept almost all of them. (I think the only one on his list that no one at any time in the early church accepted was ""Jasher"", because all three of the so-called ""Jasher"" books today are definitely not the one referenced in the bible, and it an extremely late post-Christian forgery.

This show is rather a fun fact for believers and not some validate source of theological knowledge.

at least that's how I perceive these things.

But this creator should definitely add a note statement at beginning of this show - about such status. For the sake of accuracy and propriety and avoidance of misconceptions.

      Secondarily, what i personally think, for grown believer this show will be only source of confoundation - as was for me, when i used to watch for first time. This show sometimes seemed to me too ridiculous to be true , and i felt confounded, other time emotionally triggered- As this is the purpose of any show - to make you feel that way.

 that's why overall, this show is purely entertaining , and such should be considered this way.

         Now this is your choice if you want to entertain in it - As a believer you should be aware of dangers and you should know what you should do or you should not to do.

You can watch it, enjoy it, ponder it and move on, or you can completely base your spiritual understanding on those images and mix all things up.

         Finally, what I honestly think, entertainment is not something really in line with bible spirit - making movies and after scrupulously eating it, is a stagnate kind of activity in regard to God, God glory, in regard to God will and following Jesus - as man does not live by bread alone - so, in my feeling I don't think it is God's work and that he is behind it.

Still, Books will be always most reliable, and trustworthy source of informational transmission. 

Books are almost completely neutral and devoid of self-praise; the literal word is also most close to spirit; Movies are far more sensory, not as accurate and therefore more unwholesome to spirit and not as reliable as literature.

It is my opinion, what I think about this show - as you see on first part of my comment i do not condemn the show, but also, I do not recommend it.

In my opinion it is for God to judge creator of this show and his aspirations.

Rookie Cookie,"2:06 Which is it? What are we saved by (or through) alone? It can't be all three that we are saved by alone, because then they aren't alone!
How about you quote the Bible and find where it says ""We are saved by faith alone"" because it only says ""Faith alone"" in one place, James, and it has a ""Not by"" before the ""Faith alone"" part. We are saved by faith, and that faith isn't alone.
Grace alone? Grace is presented through Christ alone, but the grace isn't alone, it has Christ. However there is no other name given under heaven by which we must be saved, which is why we are saved through Christ alone. (there is only one place where one of these three ""alones"" is actually mentioned in the Bible, and it is grace presented through ""Christ alone"". We know by Paul and James that ""Faith without works is dead"" and ""What shall we say then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may abound? By no means!"" So it is obvious that faith is not alone, and grace is not alone, but there is no other name given under heaven by which we must be saved except Christ, so it is through Christ alone that we are saved)

Let me tell you something no one heard Jesus say, ""If you truly love me, you don't have to obey. You can enter the kingdom just by saying 'Lord Lord', and the will of my Father? Just use grace to ignore.""

When Paul tells us that it is by grace through faith that we are saved he tells the truth, but unlike what you believe—grace is presented through Christ alone only to those who present to God a completed faith. A completed faith is not absent of works, lest it be dead. ""I desire mercy, not sacrifice."" and ""I desire obedience, not sacrifice.""
So we can never sacrifice enough to earn salvation, but if God commanded sacrifice from us before he would set aside our sins, would we not have to be obedient to the command? Indeed, we would, for even though ""the blood of bulls and goats can never take away sin"", as the Hebrew writer tells us, the Levites had to sacrifice—because God commanded it.
But God did not accept every sacrifice, a sacrifice of bulls and goats given by a hypocrite would not be accepted by God, God desired sacrifice of thanksgiving. If his people pay heed to the weightier matters of the law, he would accept their sacrifice of bulls and goats and fulfill his covenant with them, setting aside their sins until that day when he provided the sacrifice for sins. On that day Jesus, who had fulfilled all the law and the prophets, was made the sacrifice for sins—the only sacrifice that can truly take away sins, for ""who can forgive sins but God alone?"" He has done it!
Nevertheless, sacrifice was never what took away the sins of the people of Israel, it simply set aside their sins until the law could be fulfilled. God forgave sins, and forgives sins today, but not for anyone. He forgives the sins of those who first do not forget the weightier matters of the law, (Love, faithfulness, kindness, righteousness. Lovers of God, and not lovers of self) and then are obedient to him. This is why Peter tells us by the Spirit, ""Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.""
Repent! Turn aside from every evil way and love the Lord your God with all your heart. However, this is where the Devil has tricked so many. He says that repentance is enough, that telling God ""I will do your will"" and then becoming a ""Better person"" by living a good life is all God wants, and ignores the instructions given by Peter, and preached by Paul.
""You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former!""
You practice the weightier matters, but ignore the sacrifice of God by neglecting the command of obedience given to us to accept salvation—you refuse to dip in the Jordon seven times because ""I thought he would simply wave his hand over me, and I would be healed.""
You have neglected to accept the sacrifice, and you tell those who would accept the sacrifice of Christ, who desire to follow Peter's instruction ""and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins,"" that if they are baptized for the reason Peter states, they will be hell bound for trying to earn salvation.
You hypocrite! If you dip because you believe the waters cleanse you, then you haven't comprehended the whole purpose of the law and the prophets. If you dip ""in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins,"" then you are not sacrificing anything! You aren't looking for a salvation of ""works"" if you are being obedient to the command! Christ cleanses us, but if we say ""I thought he would simply wave his hand over me and I would be clean"" are we not being proud and disobedient? Let God have mercy on whom he will have mercy, but you, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
Know this, if Naaman had told Elisha, ""I know that baptism cannot heal my leprosy, come out and wave your hand over me and make me clean."" I tell you the truth, though acknowledging the power of the God of Israel, he would have been ignoring the authority of the Most High God by speaking in this way. He would never have been healed.
Yet you not only ignore the teachings of God for yourself, but you teach falsely to others, and condemn those who would seek and teach truth as God has commanded!
If we are baptized we are not baptized to be divided, we are baptized because ""Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you."" and ""For all of us who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.""
""Now why do you wait? Arise and be baptized, washing away your sins, calling on his name.""

Paul did not come to baptize, because baptism given by the apostles was no more significant that baptism given by the weakest brother. Paul came to preach the truth, and he never neglected to teach baptism. Entire families were baptized the very night Paul spoke to them, because there was urgency. We must be born again of both water and spirit, or we will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
Nevertheless, I pray that God would have mercy on those who have been sincerely deceived to reject the priestly garments, to refuse to put on the wedding clothes, who never put on Christ, because they were sincerely deceived. But as for you and me? Let us each work out our own salvation with fear and trembling, and seek to, by any means possible, obtain the life and glory of Christ.

John Cassidy,"The Gospels are a record, not a dramatization. It is impossible for a record (so that we may believe) to be as evocative as a dramatization. As a basis, the average modern American reader lacks the context of customs and idioms that the Gospels take as obvious to its contemporary readers. The historical context can flesh things out and  dramatization can bring to mind things that the record simply leaves out as understood. 

Also, I think you commit a flagrant mischaracterization of what Jenkins said specifying the stories of Jesus, when you widened it to a general agreement ""about Jesus"". I think there is a reason that Jenkins answered that the stories are universal, even if what you take from the layout of the story is different. In the Gospels Jesus withers a fig tree. If a dramatization depicts that action, it has represented the Gospel. In the Gospels, Jesus does not explain how the fig tree is the traditional symbol of Judaism and how Jesus is illustrating that the time of Israel as God's instrument is over because his hour is imminent. But a dramatization can explain that. Specifically by putting words into Jesus' (or disciples' mouths)  that is not in the record of that event. The text of Matthew actually makes it about Jesus being hungry and how with faith you can perform this miracle as well. And that telling kind of makes Jesus a little more spontaneous. But a dramatization can illustrate a theological theme of what it means for Jesus to be ""hungry"" so that he wants fruit from the tree that represents Israel. And that would be by adding theological context--that Matthew does not explicitly contain. If we just need to add a scene around that incident to reveal the reason the Holy Spirit has chosen this incident, which wasn't simply cut out as one of the ""many other signs and wonders"" of Jesus. 

Mark even adds ""When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs."" So it's not even about a reasonable expectation of getting figs to satisfy Jesus's hunger. You could not get the same reaction out of the text of the story in Matthew in Mark as you could an elucidating scene. Jesus couldn't expect any figs from the tree, so is it just the case of Jesus flexing? Or did he want to fix an image into the minds of the 12? 

Now, even if one lacks that particular theological explanation to it, you can present the story according to the Gospels with no further comment, and allow people to come away with their own conclusions, and you still have been faithful to the _story_. You can't equate the presentation of the story for the interpretation of the context of the story. Scripture is actually more enigmatic in the story of the fig tree, and both Matthew and Mark both contain the simple case that Jesus was simply hungry, because those were likely the words he used. 

One of my favorite episodes so far was the episode on Nathaniel (and for some odd reason, I was waiting for that one). And I've read dozens of times that Jesus says that he saw Nathaniel underneath the tree praying. And in that simple exchange in the Gospels, Jesus says he saw Nathaniel under the tree and Nathaniel is astounded and commits himself to Jesus. End of ""story"". I could not have had the same emotional reaction to that in the Bible as I did the context that Jenkin's story puts around it. But because I know scripture reasonably well, I know what was true to the vignette and what was put there to evoke the significance in Nathaniel's life, which we just take as read in the Gospel. That must have impressed Nathaniel, who doubted that anything good can come from Nazareth previously, but the Bible never illustrates exactly why.",Against,,"

Christians should definitely be wary of things and judge a tree for its fruits like Jesus Commands.  That said Jesus and God has often used very sinful people for his work, and we all must recognize we are all sinners and in need of Jesus!  

It bothers me when Christianity and Christian content becomes IM RIGHT and YOUR WRONG all the time!!

That said, it does concern me about the Concessions of the CHOSEN with LDS Church.   The 3 BOOKS the LDS adds are dangerous as the BIBLE is GODS word and is sufficient!!  The LDS has LEVELS to their CHURCH and this is perhaps the most troubling.  Gods kingdom in heaven isn't earned through any Works and we are ALL ON THE SAME LEVEL as believers.  Also the LDS has some bizarre beliefs about JESUS and this makes them a CULT.  I love MORMON families and Family Life,  but their THEOLOGY is flawed for sure...",Against,,"

Antonio Rodriguez,"Is the Catholic Church Jesus’ original church?

The quotes provided below are historical facts in reference to our early church which existed prior to Romes adoption of Christianity in 313 A.D.

Church:

* ""Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.” [St. Ignatius of Antioch - Letter to the Smyrneans 8 (c. A.D. 110)]

Bishop, Priest & Deacon:

* “Since, then, I have had the privilege of seeing you, through Damas your most worthy bishop, and through your worthy presbyters Bassus and Apollonius, and through my fellow-servant the deacon Sotio, whose friendship may I ever enjoy, because he is subject to the bishop as to the grace of God, and to the presbytery as to the law of Jesus Christ [St. Ignatius of Antioch- Letter to the Magnesians 2 (c. A.D. 110)].

Eucharist:

* “Take note of those who hold heterodox opinions on the grace of Jesus Christ, which have come to us, and see how contrary their opinions are to the mind of God... They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer because they do not confess that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ, Ash that suffered for our sins and that the Father, in his goodness, raised up again. They who deny the gift of God are perishing in their disputes.” [St. Ignatius of Antioch - Letter to the Smyrnaeans 6-7 (c. A.D. 110)].

Scripture:

* “[W]hoever perverts the sayings of the Lord for his own desires, and says that there is neither resurrection nor judgment, is the firstborn of Satan. Let us leave the foolishness and the false teaching of the crowd and turn back to the word that was delivered to us in the beginning.” [St. Polycrap of Smyrna - Letter to the Philippians 7 (c. A.D. 135)].

Sunday:

* “But Sunday is the day on which we all hold our common assembly, because it is the first day on which God, having wrought a change in the darkness and matter, made the world; and Jesus Christ our Savior on the same day rose from the dead.” [St. Justin Martyr - First Apology 67 (c. A.D. 151)].

Actions/Works:

* “We have learned from the prophets, and we believe it is true, that punishments, and chastisements, and good rewards, are rendered according to the merit of each man's actions. If it is not so, then all things happen by fate, and nothing is in our own power. If it is fated that this man be good, and this other evil, the former is not meritorious nor the latter blameworthy [St. Justin Martyr - First Apology 43 (c. A.D. 151)].

Apostolic Succession:

* “It is within the power of all, in every church, who may wish to see the truth, to contemplate clearly the Tradition of the apostles manifested throughout the whole world; and we are in a position to reckon up those who were instituted bishops in the churches by the apostles, and [to demonstrate] the succession of these men to our own times; those who neither taught nor knew anything these [heretics] rave about.”  [St. Irenaeus of Lyons - Against Heresies 3:3:1 (c. A.D. 189)]

Baptism:

* “The children shall be baptized first. All the children who can answer for themselves, let them answer. If there are any children who cannot answer for themselves, let their parents answer for them, or someone else from their family.” [St. Hippolytus of Rome - Apostolic Tradition 21 (c. A.D. 215)].

Confession: 

* “After this, one of the bishops present, at the request of all, laying his hand on him who is ordained bishop, shall pray this way: O God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. pour forth the power that is from you, of ""the princely Spirit' that you delivered to your beloved Child, Jesus Christ, and that he bestowed on your holy apostles, who established the Church that hallows you everywhere, for the endless glory and praise of your name. Father, ""who knows the hearts [of all]” grant this servant, who you have chosen for the episcopate, to feed your holy flock and serve as your high priest blamelessly night and day, and unceasingly turn away wrath from your face and offer to you the gifts of the holy Church. And that by the high priestly Spirit he may have authority ""to forgive sins"" according to your command.” [St. Hippolytus of Rome - Apostolic Tradition 2-3 (c. A.D. 215)].

Confirmation: 

* “The bishop will then lay his hand upon them, invoking, ""Lord God, you who have made these worthy of the removal of sins through the bath of regeneration, make them worthy to be filled with your Holy Spirit, grant to them your grace, that they might serve you according to your will, for to you is the glory, Father and Son with the Holy Spirit, in the holy Church, now and throughout the ages of the ages. Amen."" After this he pours the oil into his hand, and laying his hand on each of their heads, says, ""I anoint you with holy oil in God the Father Almighty, and Christ Jesus, and the Holy Spirit."" Then, after sealing each of them on the forehead, he shall give them the kiss of peace and say, ""The Lord be with you."" And the one who has been baptized shall say, ""And with your spirit."" So shall he do to each one [St. Hippolytus of Rome - Apostolic Tradition 21-22 (c. A.D. 215).

Peter’s Authority:

* “The Lord says to Peter: ""I say to you,' he says, “that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it. And to you I will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven. [Mt 16:18-19]. On him he builds the Church, and commands him to feed the sheep [Jn 21:17], and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair [cathedra], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity. Indeed the others were also what Peter was [apostles], but a primacy is given to Peter, by which it is made clear that there is one Church and one chair.... If someone does not hold fast to this unity of Peter, can he think that he holds the faith? If he deserts the chair of Peter upon whom the Church was built, can he be confident that he is in the Church?.” [St. Cyprian of Carthage - Unity of the Catholic Church 4; first edition (Treatise 1:4) (A.D. 251)].

These few topics (but a glimpse) were not only discussed but settled BEFORE Rome adopted Christianity (The Catholic Church) and eventually became The Roman Catholic Church as it also adopted its name after 313 A.D. 

Is the Catholic Church Jesus’ original church? Yes!  

Does this excuse all its mistakes and sins from the record? Of course not! As Christians, we are called to hold the church accountable, not leave it and let evil flourish within it. 

This refusal of accountability within every Christian has led to over 40,000 diferente Christian churches and the ignorance which has flourished from it.

“This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God’s Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ. Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won’t be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth. Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church.” Ephesians‬ ‭4:13-15‬

If you are going to believe it, you cannot in any way delete doctrines you are uncomfortable with and change its meaning. Like the Jews and Pharisees, there are church folk today stuck in a mental rut. “If it ain’t logical and understandable, I’m out.” Human wisdom has tripped up many before you and will stumble many after you. Clinging to the truth of scripture is your only safety. You don’t interpret the Bible — it interprets you. Do you have its promised fruit, power, miraculous interventions from God, softness of heart, repentance? Brokenness and contrition are extremely rare qualities today. When God sees them He shows up irregardless of past sins. (I’ll let the religious fume on that one for a minute...) Babes are imperfect, irrational, needy and messy. The religious cannot stand them.

M,"1.  The Bible is scripture.  Its purpose is to inform and edify.  First, it is love letter from God, telling us who He is, that He loves us and wants us to be in relationship with Him.  He tells us what He has done for us, who His Son, Jesus Messiah is, and shows us  the right relationship with God through Jesus.  Third, the Bible is 66 books of history, poetry, and prophecy.  The one thing the Bible is not, is fiction.  Fiction is intended to entertain, relax and amuse, but fiction can never make a claim of ultimate truth.  The Chosen makes it clear that it is fiction, and it points watchers to the Bible for the truth of who Jesus Christ is.  The program is very direct and explicit about this, starting with disclaimer statements at the beginning of each episode.  The Chosen never makes the claim of being ""another gospel of Jesus,"" or of adding to the words of scripture.  Should we apply Todd's test to all Christian fiction?  Should we avoid C.S. Lewis's fictional ""Screwtape Letters,"" ""The Great Divorce,"" and ""Perelandra""?  What about ""Left Behind""?  Do classics such as John Bunyan's ""The Pilgrim's Progress, John Milton's ""Paradise Lost,"" and Dante Aligheiri's ""Divine Comedy"" fail the test?

2.  It is true that Angel Studios, financed by the Latter-Day Saints produces The Chosen.  Financing the series COULD result in undue influence, but there is no evidence that it has so far.  The alternative is to finance through the Hollywood system, such as was done with Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" and countless other Christian-themed programs.  Perhaps we can find a better alignment of values through The Weinstein Company or Steven Speilberg's Amblin Entertainment.

3.  Dallas Jenkins, son of Left Behind coauthor Jerry Jenkins, produces The Chosen from an evangelical worldview.  He does include a Catholic Priest (and I believe a Jewish Rabbi) on his theological panel, along with other evangelical theologians.  

The question I have for Todd and for others who have actually studied the content is this:  ""Can they point to any consistent pattern of false or misleading theology actually presented in The Chosen's story?""   I haven't seen it.  I have found what I believe to be errors, but not a consistently false message.  I can also find errors in other Christian fiction, certainly in Lewis's The Great Divorce, in Left Behind, and in The Divine Comedy.  But these do not deter me from enjoying them for what they are -- pleasing and thought-provoking stories.  The Bible is the capital-T Truth.   Good fiction can please, entertain, and even sometimes provide insight.  The two should never be confused for one another, and Dallas Jenkins is about as careful as he can be to distinguish them.",Against,,"

I know The Bible well enough that I know which things are added/just speculation, like historical fiction that fills in the gaps between historical facts. I doubt that Todd makes sure that the only people who fix his plumbing or prepare his food when he goes to a restaurant or bind his books or create the ink that goes in to making his books or pump the oil that fuels his car... is a Christian who believes exactly what he does. And holding Dallas Jenkins to that standard is ridiculous. Todd should have made his own movie doing it the way he says it ought to be done and see if anybody's interested in watching it instead of criticizing Dallas Jenkins. 99% of films about Jesus are lame and poorly done and extremely painful to watch.  I feel that every single one of Dallas Jenkins' episodes is anointed. I know what it feels like when the Holy Spirit is on something because I am a spirit-filled Christian (some of you may attack me for mentioning that,  but I was brought up Lutheran and know the difference between a dead religion and a vibrant personal relationship). I did not detect any Blasphemy in the movies, either. Dallas Jenkins isn't claiming his films are the Bible.  Does Todd ever paraphrase when talking about the Bible or Jesus???????

butrphly66,"No offense to Todd, or The Wretched channel…I very much enjoy your video content and learn much from it…BUT…

Taken from the very first scene of The Chosen…

“The Chosen is based on the true stories of the gospels of Jesus Christ. Some locations and timelines have been combined or condensed. Backstories and some characters or dialogue have been added.
However, all biblical and historical context and any artistic imagination are designed to support the truth and intention of the Scriptures. Viewers are encouraged to read the gospels. ()
The original names, locations and phrases have been transliterated into English for anything spoken.”

This clearly is written to remind us that The Chosen does NOT replace scripture, and that scripture alone is indeed sufficient. The Chosen is merely a visual interpretation that does not include anything in it that would make what’s written in the bible “false”. If anything, it enhances the word of God only enough to make the unbeliever believe or believers believe it more. 

So, yes, if you only have an hour of free time every day, then read your bible for that hour. But if you have more time, enjoy watching The Chosen as well.

The context is Jesus asks for particular works of the church or they will be removed. It goes against the no works, no merit, no authority narrative of Protestantism. Life works on merit, countries and families are fueled by works and merit, Jesus went about doing good works, God didn't create a life that requires work so that you could figure out the secret from a few badly read verses that work is valueless to getting what you want from salvation.

Chase Crawford,"I agree that we shouldn't equate The Chosen to scripture, but I don't think anyone is doing that. After reading several comments on this video, it seems that many people believe that The Gospel of John movie is okay to watch because it doesn't add words into Jesus' mouth but The Chosen is wrong for adding words. And some people even believe that Jesus didn't speak any words that were that are not in the Bible which is mind-blowing...

The Gospel of John movie is very cringy to me. It portrays Jesus as someone who is always happy and just walks around smiling all of the time.

The Chosen succeeds in helping people visualize the story of Jesus' life. Like everything, it can be good or bad depending on your faith and how you are using it. I don't think the fact that they take some liberties to make the stories feel more genuine is inherently a bad thing. When we read the Bible, we are always making assumptions about how things happened as we only have some of the details.

If you think watching the Chosen and not reading the Bible is okay, and you are memorizing the Chosen instead of the Bible then yes, that is a problem. But if you are reading your Bible more than you watch the Chosen, and are spending time in prayer on a regular basis, and you watch the Chosen and understand that it is not the word of God then there is nothing wrong with that.",Against,,"

Dn Zach,"You said a lot of words the Scriptures do not say with your commentary and application of your perspective of theology. I suppose I should be very wary of what you are saying since you made comments that were not quoting directly from God's Word. I informed my pastor that he is to only read God's Word in church and not to give us ideas of what he thinks it means or applications that he thinks it may intend no matter how plausible they may be.

I have decided to not attend our church any longer. I found out that one of the subcontractors was a Mormon. How could I ever find closeness to God if  I am in a building that  ungodly people made ?

I also discovered that the Bible I use to study God's Word was published by a publisher that  is owned by a company that owns other Publishing companies that  also publishes homosexual materials promoting that life style. So I burned my KJV of the Bible because it cannot be holy under those circumstances

I have altered my diet to include only food that the Scriptures mention Jesus as having eaten.  There may have been other things that Jesus may plausibly have eaten , but since they are not mentioned in the Scriptures, it would not be appropriate for me to eat them because I desire to keep this temple of the Holy Spirit healthy for God's service.


Oh that music you have at the intro of your shows ................ it is sinful music of the Devil . the instruments used to make that music was probably made by some who are atheists or some other non christian cults and religions.

Elliot Swaim,"1. ""If Mormons and Catholics are not offended by The Chosen, it is certainly not explicitly evangelical.""  Does that mean the Bible isn't explicitly evangelical?  Because Catholics and Mormons read those and don't seem to get offended.

2. As far as sufficiency is concerned, there's no more a problem with watching The Chosen as there is reading the church fathers or a commentary.  There is just as much a problem with treating The Chosen as equal with Scriptures as there is treating the church fathers or a commentary as equal with Scriptures.  Reading the church fathers or a commentary, listening to a sermon, and watching The Chosen can all cause us to grow closer to God, but they are not necessary.  The Scriptures is the only thing necessary for our walk with Christ.  But that doesn't mean that other things aren't helpful, particularly when they direct us right back toward the Bible.

3. You're questions are good.  Jesus didn't really say all those things, you shouldn't believe the things said in The Chosen just because they're in The Chosen (i.e. just like with a sermon, you must compare what you hear with what the Bible says), and if The Chosen moves you, make sure that it moves you to explore the real Jesus of the Bible rather than Dallas Jenkin's portrayal of him.  

But as for portraying Jesus being blasphemy, is it blasphemy for a preacher to expound on what Jesus said by rhetorically putting it in the voice of Jesus?  Is it blasphemy to sing hymns like ""I Saw One Hanging on the Tree"" which put words in Jesus' mouth?  Is it blasphemy for a movie to show someone praying to God because they're not actually praying to God for real, so they're using God's name in vain?

Blasphemy would be to claim that Jesus said something he didn't say.  However, Dallas Jenkins explicitly says that The Chosen is historical fiction: he does not claim that Jesus said the exact words he spoke in the show.  Jesus in The Chosen is not meant to be the Jesus in the Bible.  Rather, he is meant to be a portrayal of the Jesus in the Bible.  The things he says in The Chosen are a portrayal of the things the Bible says about the real Jesus.  When Jesus in The Chosen makes small talk, that's a portrayal of the Biblical fact that Jesus was fully human in addition to being fully God.  When Jesus in The Chosen gives a mini sermon that's not found in the Bible, that is a portrayal of the theology taught in the Bible.  The exact words are not meant to be Jesus' but Dallas Jenkin's.  But the concepts are meant to be the Bible's.  Therefore, if The Chosen portrayed Jesus as sinful or in a way that was fundamentally contradictory to who he really is or had him say something that went against what the Bible teaches, then that would be blasphemy, because while the Jesus of The Chosen is not meant to be the real Jesus, it is meant to represent him.  The things a preacher says are meant to represent the things the Bible says, and James 3:1 says that teachers will face a stricter judgement if they teach falsehoods.  So also the things the Jesus in The Chosen says are meant to represent the things the Bible says, and Dallas Jenkins will receive a stricter judgement if he teaches falsehoods through that.  But if the things Dallas Jenkins teaches through The Chosen are biblical, then it is not blasphemous to put words into Jesus' mouth because those words are not claimed to be the very words of God but are only representational of the words of God (like a sermon).",Against,,"

An actual sitting down to pray together and be humble enough to go after facts peer to peer, instead of pulling old clips and out of context videos, just to justify a point of view (which can be totally theological), but completely unnecessary.

Instead, you run the risk of promoting a channel that ""spreads the gossip gospel"", ""with the best of intentions""... I'm sure it would be beneficial to your channel.

ccbean0462,"As a challenge to some of the statements made, particularly that the Bible alone has everything that you need, would Todd say to avoid commentaries or sermons? Why would you need to hear your preacher preach a man-made sermon when he could just read straight from the Bible and call it a day? Commentaries set out to clarify Scripture by adding to what Scripture says (reading between the lines so to speak).  If all of Scripture is inspired by God, then all of the words therein are Jesus' words.  So anyone who expounds on Scripture is putting words in Jesus' mouth. I have heard many pastors use a line like, ""What Jesus is saying here is..."" How is what The Chosen is doing any different?

All that said, obviously I believe that preachers are necessary and commentaries are helpful.  I also believe that great care should be taken when preaching or writing a commentary. The Chosen is simply a commentary of a different medium.  The show grants the audience a visual understanding of the setting and time period (Ancient Rome).  It really gives clarity on the relationships that the disciples would have had, for example, how hated Matthew likely would have been given that he was a tax collector.  We see the disciples bickering in Scripture but now we can see the tension visually and relate to it more.  I had always wondered how the disciples could have been so ignorant for so long as to who Jesus was.  Watching this show has given me an idea as to why Jesus' divinity would have been so hard to see for those around Him.  Apart from the miracles, just as Scripture says, there was nothing special about Him that would have caused you to give Him a second look.  However, just like commentaries and sermons, the show comes second to Scripture.

My first red flag was when I noticed Dallas Jenkins is not very theologically mature when it comes to what actually defines Christianity. He seems like a great guy that has sadly been a little too influenced by the evanjellyfish culture of the 21st century west - where anything and everything is ""Christian"" so long as it is invoking the name of Jesus. I have been incredibly discouraged (having seen countless interviews where he is pressed on the subject) to watch Dallas refuse to admit that Mormons and Catholics aren't Christian, and are not saved. Any theologically mature Christian who has studied Mormonism knows they teach a false god and a works-based gospel that can't save. Any theologically mature Christian that is familiar with Rome knows that while affirming the Trinity (yes, there are Mary issues), also teaches a works-based gospel that can't save. Both also deny the supremacy of Scripture in the life of a Christian. 

These aren't ""little"" issues, or ""secondary"" issues. To have salvation is to have the true God and the true Gospel. Dallas is sacrificing a tremendous platform he has to preach the Gospel boldly and is rather providing a watered-down stance on anything that invokes the name of Jesus to avoid offending potential viewers. I have also been discouraged to see him grow the show into what he considers to be a powerful evangelistic tool. God gave us the Gospel as the ONLY means by which people can be saved, coming under the hearing of the Gospel and believing. Not by watching a dramatized TV series about Jesus that is 97% things that Jesus ""could've said"" or ways that Jesus ""could've acted"". It is awful to think about how many people have watched this show and fallen in love with a Jesus that is, while not saying anything outright blasphemous, an incredibly watered down take on the true God-man who called sinners to repentance.

Charles Brown,"1.	Show me any line or scene from the script which contradicts standard Biblical theology. I'll wait. Maybe you might actually watch The Chosen for yourself instead of believing the 5th generation rumors originally spawned by YouTube video hucksters!

2.	The script, which is the backbone of the show, is written by three Evangelical writers whose only influence is the Bible. 

3.	Regarding ""adding to the Bible"", a pastor's sermon or a Bible teacher's outline/notes are additions to the Bible. They simply illustrate what the Bible verses are saying. And don't forget what has been left out of the Gospel accounts (cf. John 20:30; 21:25) which The Chosen could plausibly include.

4.	Why can't cinematic art, in its own way and written by Evangelicals, also illustrate what the Bible is saying? That includes direct Bible quotes and the backstory surrounding it.

5.	The Chosen is technically a secular TV production. It is not a church ministry, sect, or denomination, nor is it a textual addition to the Bible. It is simply a TV series inspired by the Bible. Are you as critical of other Hollywood productions of similar shows?

6.	Speaking of Hollywood productions, that isn't The Chosen. It is crowd-funded by fans, not produced by people who are lockstep with the world's values and agendas.

7.	The religious or non-religious proclivities, personal lives, and politics of the production team, actors, and crew are irrelevant so long as the script is being followed. They are paid professionals who know how to follow the script as directed. That is all that matters.

8.	There are the testimonies of people from all over the world who have been blessed by the series and who were pointed to the Biblical Jesus and study of the Bible itself. The Chosen is a tool, a steppingstone to the Light of God's Word.

9.	I reject the argument that any cinematic depiction of God or Jesus is a violation of the 2nd Commandment which should be interpreted in the historical context of the Ten Commandments, which was for Israel only. They were not to construct an image in place of God and worship the image. So long as anything or anyone in The Chosen is not being worshipped or venerated, then it is a NON-ISSUE.

10.	God can and will use whatever He wants to point people to Jesus and the Kingdom of God. The Chosen's purpose as stated by Dallas is to point people to the Bible. It's prideful to think we know how God should work. We cannot and should not put Him in a box.

11.	Jesus told made up stories (parables) that weren't scriptural to illustrate the Kingdom of God and point people to the Father and to Himself. The Holy Spirit can use made-up stories to enhance contextual understanding and point people to the real Jesus. Storytelling need not be viewed as dangerous.

12.	Concerning lies being spread about Dallas: Christians should not engage in gossip. If they want to know what Dallas really thinks they should watch HIS videos sharing HIS heart. Not other's (prideful) opinion of a person's heart that they know nothing about because they most likely have not listened to Dallas either.",Against,,"

Are you a robot programmed to be moved only by reading the Bible which btw is not very easily understandable for the modern man?! The Christian Faith is not the Faith of the book or any book. It is a Faith LIVED OUT, given testimony to by human beings who surrender mind, heart, body and soul to Jesus Christ. THAT is what can move you. Not that Holy Scripture would NEVER be able to move you, but you cannot make a case that ONLY the Bible should move you.

While I do disagree with Dallas about the Mormon Jesus being the same Jesus, he's not wrong that this show is/can be the middle of the venn diagram between those beliefs. The stories of the life of Christ are believed by both parties. 

""Are you sure you want to consume a subpar Jesus that doesn't offend the unorthodox"" -  because this show isn't spanning the entire realm of theology and debate, that's just fine with me. Subpar would be the many depictions of Jesus I've watched that were more concerned with transcribing the Bible on screen vs presenting Him in a different medium. 

They make it clear that this isn't the Bible so they aren't ""adding to His words"" and The Chosen is as ""unauthorized"" a source as the the writings of Tozer, Lewis, Calvin, even Johnny Mac's precious commentaries... they ""add to Scripture"" too yet we're all fine acknowledging that they bring life, value, and understanding to The Bible. 

There isn't danger in consuming non-canonical works as long as you can differentiate between the two. The show routinely says ""THIS ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID"" so therefore it's not blasphemy at all. This show has stoked the desire of many people I know to get into their word further. It's artistic expression much like the picture of Jesus and the children (patsy white as he was drawn) I had as a kid.

There is no biblical reference that supports the uncreated Jesus, that is false doctrine. 2. Saying we don't believe in the same Jesus is ignorance. Protestants and Evangelicals think that anyone who doesn't believe like them is not Christian. I remember a real-life conversation between a Catholic Priest and a Latter-day Saint at a Religious conference. The Catholic Priest approached the Latter-day Saint Representative and said, ""You Mormons don't understand your position."" The Latter-day Saint representative looked confused and asked what did he mean. The Catholic Priest then said, ""The Protestants and Evangelicals don't have a foothold on truth. If  The Catholic Church is the true church, they are apostates and are wrong. If you (meaning the Latter-day Saints) are the true church, then we are wrong and so are they"". He is right, the protestant movement has no right in declaring anyone wrong because they either abandoned the true church and started their own religion, then are persecuting them. If the Latter-day Saints are correct that the church needed a full restoration, then the Catholic Church is wrong and all churches that spawned from it are also wrong.",Against,,"

Your Fanfiction! HD,"Brothers, with love I say this and I hope no one stumble by any of my word. People love the likeable Jesus of the Chosen, saying this Jesus brought them closer to the real one of the bible. God be praised! I believe on that, I believe God use even evil for good. But can us handle the Christ of the bible? The God of the bible? In human failed eyes God is NOT always likeable. God (who is also Jesus), can take very harsh decisions and bring suffering because we ARE evil. God punish the evil because all of us deserve punishment and hell. He salved us because HE is good. Jesus is love and justice.
God is truly to the truth and He IS the truth. The Chosen can make everyone in the bible very heartwarming, relatable and modern. But ecumenism is always wrong, altered bible is always wrong. No matter how touched we feel about the serie. 
Jesus is not the nice guy, He is GOOD, and GOOD is different than NICE. Should us Christians accept seasoning the truth for the purpose of reaching more people?
Also, not forget the the marketer puppy for The Chosen is Satan, which I consider a poor choice.",For,,"

SeekingPerfection Philippians 3:12,"There was a division over who Jesus was when he walked the earth and there still is to this day. (John 7:12, 40-43/John 9:16, 17/John 10:19-21) So, many claim Christ, but why so many denominations in Christ? That goes against God and Christ (1 Corinthians 1:10-15) So, please read and study the scriptures sited until the end. I will explain all “Jesus is God proof texts”

Psalm 110:10 states: The LORD/YHWH said to my (King David) Lord (Jesus) sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool. Jesus the servant (Acts 3:13, 26) and lamb (John 1:29) of God obeyed God even to death. (Philippians 2:5-11) Jesus is the image of God (Colossians 1:15/2 Corinthians 4:3, 4) as Adam was made in God’s image (Genesis 1:26, 27/Luke 3:38) Jesus being the second Adam (1 Corinthians 15:45) see we took on the first Adams image and likeness (Genesis 5:3/Romans 5:12-21/1 Corinthians 15:20-22) but God has made provisions thru Jesus Christ and we are allowed to be children of God if we believe in the one God sent (John 1:12/2 Corinthians 5:18) Jesus spoke what God told him to speak (John 12:49, 50/Deuteronomy 18:18/Isaiah 51:16) the apostles never taught Jesus was God/YHWH/Yahweh/Jehovah neither did Jesus himself (Luke 24:19/Acts 2:22/John 14:10, 11/1 Corinthians 8:5, 6/1 Timothy 2.5/John 17:3/Mark 12:28-34) bottom line is Jesus is our king and the Son of God (Matthew 16:13-17) Zero scriptures say you must believe Jesus is God, but there are scriptures that say you must believe he is the Son of God. (1 John 5:5, 9-13) also Jesus was a Jew, the Jews needed convincing of no longer needing the circumcision to be justified in the eyes of God. (Romans 3, 4/Acts 15/Galatians 2) but there are zero scriptures to convince the Jews of a 3 in 1 God or that Jesus is or was God. 

Besides Jesus didn’t exist until being placed in the womb of the Virgin Mary (Matthew 1:18-21/Luke 1:35) by the Holy Spirit which comes from heaven (1 Peter 1:12) (formed in the womb Isaiah 49:5) God is Jesus’s God from the womb but not before b/c Jesus didn’t exist yet (Psalm 22:10) and since Jesus didn’t exist until the womb no one was worthy in heaven on earth or under the earth until Jesus (Revelation 5:1-14) Since Jesus is of the Holy Spirit (which comes from heaven 1 Peter 1:12) this is why Jesus can rightly say he is from heaven and not made of the earth (John 8:23) like the first Adam Genesis 2:7

Recall Noah walked the earth before it was destroyed by the flood. Genesis chapters 6-9. So Noah walked the old earth and the New earth after he came out of the ark. Same with Jesus (Micah 5:2 from the old age, some say from eternity past/John 1:10) Jesus walked the old earth before the foundation of the New earth/world which was laid in his blood/made thru Jesus by God. (Isaiah 51:16/2 Corinthians 5:17/Psalm 65:17) This also helps explain the glory Jesus shared with God before the new world John 17:5 these scriptures help show how he shared such glory while walking the old earth. John 1:14/John 2:11/John 11:4

“Jesus is God proof texts” debunked.
JOHN 8:58 ego eimi means “I am he” not “I AM!” It is said by healed blind man at John 9:9, angel Gabriel at Luke 1:19, apostle Peter at Acts 10:21. It is not a claim to deity or being God. Jesus was simply stating he is first in all things (Colossians 1:15, 17, 18/Revelation 5/Acts 26:23) even before Abraham in the resurrection. Remember the first will be last and the last first. (Luke 13:29, 30) 
JOHN 20:28 “My Lord and My God” Jesus revealed God to them/him for God was with Jesus (John 1:18/Matthew 11:27/Luke 10:22/2 Corinthians 4:3, 4/Acts 10:38/John 8:29/John 16:32/John 14:19, 20)
JOHN 1:1 could be translated “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. And what God was/is the Word was/is. So, what is God? God is Spirit (John 4:24) and Jesus was raised in the Spirit (1 Peter 3:18) and we know Jesus is Spirit because flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Corinthians 15:50) also John 1:1 is a prologue , meaning it tells WHAT happened, before it tells HOW it happened. So, at the time of John writing his gospel Jesus has already ascended and is already at the right hand of God. Because he (Jesus) was obedient even to death (Philippians 2:8-11) That is why (Jesus) was/is with God. And while Jesus was on earth God was with him. (See above about JOHN 20:28 note) Then John 1:6 begins the explanation of how it all happened. It is the same with Genesis chapters 1 and 2. And the Tower of Babel if you read the chapter before the story of Babel it tells how they left each with their own language then they tell how it all happened. Genesis chapter 10 and 11.
JOHN 1:3 explains these verses (Colossians 1:16/Luke 22:28-30/Revelation  1:5/Revelation 5:9, 10) The new beginning that God created, is laid in Christ blood (Isaiah 51:16/2 Corinthians 5:17/Galatians 6:14, 15) Jesus was slain from the foundation of the world (Revelation 13:8) the apostles were chosen before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4) what the apostles were speaking about was the New creation (Hebrews 2:5) All of this is about the beginning, but the beginning of the new creation which is laid in Christ Jesus. 
JOHN 1:4, 5 explains John 5:19-23, 26/John 8:12/John 11:25/John 14:6/1 Corinthians 15:45
Philippians 2:5-11 explains Jesus who was created perfect in God’s image/form just as Adam was (1 Corinthians 15:45) but lowered himself/humbled himself to resemble our sinful state since we are in Adams image (Genesis 5:3) if Jesus were God and we are to have the same mindset as Jesus then we are to think we are equal with God?
Acts 20:28 God is Spirit he did not purchase the church with his own blood, God doesn’t have blood, but the Son of God did. This is a scribal error or scribes trying to influence their own doctrine or ideas (which is well documented) as with 1 Timothy 3:16/Romans 9:5/Titus 2:13/Hebrews 1:8/Psalm 45:6 (your throne is God which makes sense when Revelation 3:21 is read) Matthew 28:19 (no other scripture says to baptize in any name but Jesus) 
1 John 5:7/Jude 5 it was God not Jesus who saved the people from Egypt. It was Jesus who shed his blood and died (Romans 8:34) God cannot die. In fact God left Jesus during his death precisely because the Spirit of God cannot die. Mark 15:34..

I’ll end with this scripture John 4:22",Drop,,"

Folks here have a problem with the Chosen not being entirely scripture,  well I'm sure Father has a problem with us not knowing and using His name He gave us 5,000 times in the old testament. Jews changed the tradition after Judah returned from babylonian bondage but until then His name was used instead of Lord and God. His name is Yahweh, Yahooah. Yah is His name and His son's name is Yeshua Hamashiach, means salvation. Many doctrines have mislead us why trouble the Chosen

Running Soulja,"I don't get it, the Bible we use are all picked because of so many books but they were voted on by who, who cannanised the book, the catholic church picked the books. If u believe those are the only books we should have in the Bible, ur saying the catholic church was not wrong on putting what books went in and who is the church that makes a Saint. Do u know they have to be cannanised by the church to be a Saint. I'm not a catholic but I know who picked the books we see in the Bible and cannon comes from the catholic church. If u believe the other books mean nothing then u really believe what a church everyone says is wrong but everything we do in church is handed down by them and u should believe in praying to a Saint because u can't have it both ways. If it is cannon u believe it and making a Saint is cannon so what, u have to believe in both. U can't pick and choose what you believe. Me I believe and learn from the books that teach us what else happened because we have those books for a reason. They are not cannon but I don't need a church to tell me I am not allowed to know the other books and they don't go against the Bible, they confirm that who ever wrote the book had to be there and know about what nobody could unless it wasn't imspited by God because they couldn't guess and it matches what we know today. They did not have a book to look at and see if they match what God says and did but nobody can tell you how long did it take Noah to build the ark, 120 years. Where and how do I know it and the man talking can't tell you how long did it take to build the ark, I just told you 120 years. U know how I know. I want u to find it in the other books and see if they want tell you. I will tell you where I got that answer, the book of jasher. But it's a book of Enoch, Peter, Mary and I want name them all but u can't talk about the catholic church because you go by what they picked and believe now that's all u need to know but u can't tell me the answer to my question, what if some one who doesn't know ask you, just tell them it doesn't say because it doesn't in the Bible but it tells you in the book they left out. The book of Adam and jasher tells you how Cain was killed but you learn because you can still learn but are you set by the rules of the Roman catholic church. He tells you that you don't have to know what the other books said and these were written when Jesus was not here for 6 thousand years, he can't talk about the church because he believes they picked the right books but buy his book, he has the answer but can't tell you one thing about Cain or 120 years. He can now because I just told him but he will claim he knew but tell u why the books don't count, the church didn't pick them. If he says different, he's not telling the truth but he can tell you in his book lol",Against,,"

Don Blosser,"Actually, I don't get it.
And how can Jenkins claim that the content is ""faithful"" when he admits that 90% if it is made up and imaginary?
And how can he say that Christians and Mormons ""love the same Jesus"" when the Mormon ""jesus"" evolved from a created being into a ""god""? Is Jenkins deranged or lying, posessed, motivated by greed or what is wrong with him?  He claims that his Mormon money partners have not influenced the content but it seems obvious to me that a flawed ""jesus', whose humanity is emphasized, at the cost of his deity, is very Mormon-friendly.
I have only watched the first episode in its entirety and I was basically, ""meh"". But I but I have watched enough clips of several subsequent episodes and other Chosen related videos such as the papal audience, with a rosary blessing, to know that the ""jesus"" of the Chosen is NOT the Jesus of the Bible. It's not just making up words for ""Jesus"" to say that are not found in the Bible. It is making up words that Jesus would NEVER say because they are untrue and misleading.  Jesus never said there were things he could not do that he wanted to do. Jesus never went to one of the disciples needing help with his ""sermon prep"". Jesus never got lost because he was ""directionally challenged"". The later is a ""running gag"" on the show set, exposing the contempt they have for the Lord Jesus. There is a Chosen produced YouTube video posted 2 years ago, openly exposing this.The title is ""Is it okay to make Jesus jokes?"" and the 2:15 chapter marker title is ""Jesus is a joke"".

DANIEL NORMAN,"Fiction? Saying the same thing a different way doesn't necessarily mean it's fiction. If that were true John MacArthur has proven that the King James and almost every other version of the Bible is fiction. Dulos means slave every time it's used. The Greek stated we are slaves to Christ. Then why is it always servant or bondservant in the King James or any other translation except for one or two? just like John MacArthur says you should try to read the Bible and put yourself back in that time so that you can understand it. That's exactly what they're doing here. This isn't a Bible study. It's a relatively realistic portrayal of the stories in the New Testament with the intent of bringing you the realization of who Christ really is. I've watched season one and season 2 twice, I don't see any major problems with it. and remember John MacArthur exposit the Bible and adds a lot of words of explanation. He doesn't add to the Bible he just explains it in ways that you can comprehend it. I look forward to season 3. Although the making of it doesn't really do anything for me it's the end product that I enjoy.",Against,,"

RI,"An Islamist or one of another religion you may know that Jesus was a real prophet/person, but the truth is that Y’all’s Jesus is not the same Jesus. Mormons do not believe in the same Jesus either. The Jesus of Christianity and Messianic Jews is not a prophet, he is Lord of all. He is God— our God is a triune God… just as a man can be a father, brother, and a son, he is three in one. God exists in three persons, the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. They are not individually their own God but instead God is in them and they in God. God humbled himself to become flesh—fully man and fully God to dwell on earth for a time, therefore his sacrifice (in person of The Son) was of Himself and in doing that, He made the ultimate sacrifice, dying for the sins of the world. So that when a believer truly accepts him and has faith, God has given him the Holy Spirit to dwell within as a seal for salvation and sanctification upon death, to give discernment, and a repentant heart that hates sin. That way we live transformed, still sinners, but hating sin, fully becoming reconciled to God upon death, no man perfect in life but Christ. You can accept Jesus this day brother! Let him give you a new heart and know there will be no other gods before him!",For,,"

And could that have not been written in the Bible?,Against,,"

Michael,The chosen is very dangerous for newcomers to Christianity. It is non biblical and has almost absolutely no truth in comparison to the gospel. If you are new to Christianity and wish to see God do it through your heart through your prayers not through this guy's patient of how the Bible did not happen or the life of Jesus. This is not Jesus Christ of the King James Bible.,For,,"

Glenn Allred,"Oh please. Don't write a book or make a movie about Jesus because it's blasphemy? Of course the Bible is good enough, no one from The Chosen is saying otherwise.  The idea of reject someone completely because their theology is nonsense.  Sure you don't have to accept them as Christians, but since when did God only use Christians to speak truth?  This sounds like more of your dislike for Catholics and Mormons than it is about about truth imho.",Against,,"

Sockfoot,"You are deceitful.

Am I sure I want to watch content that is influenced by Mormons & Catholicism? Please, list the scenes in The Chosen which depict this.

Dallas has stated repeatedly that The Chosen is content to help bring people into the conversation. To get people discussing Jesus and asking questions and above all it does not take the place of Scripture. It is entertainment, he is not writing a ""religious document"".

If God can speak through a donkey, I think He can handle speaking through people.

You use a pompous hammer to try to reach people's hearts.

I am an Evangelical Christian. Do not listen to this guy. The Chosen is an awesome show! ",Against,,"

Larry Grizzle,"Not so much. You throw everyone in the same bag and condemn them all. Include yourself there too, sir. You are worthless and found wanting in God's eyes, just as we all are without Jesus. When you place yourself in the place of judge and jury using criteria that are not even absolutes in the scripture themselves you claim for yourself godlike status and you become the very thing you accuse others of being. Arguing from silence is not firm ground. Yes, God spoke and speaks through the Bible but The Holy Spirit is also still speaking. To whom? To Christians. The precious Holy Spirit also spoke through John when he told us that ""Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.""  What the Holy Spirit says will never contradict what He has already said (In the Bible) but He IS still speaking. You want absolute perfection? Give up now. Anything you ever do will fail the test just as Dallas' production is imperfect. Look at the other comments below. There are those who have been redeemed that might never have even darkened the doors of any church, and those who have returned to their First Love. Have you ever made light of scripture? My guess is that you have. Have you ever said something from the pulpit or platform that contradicts Scripture? You most surely have. (though probably not intentionally) Now, please apply the same standard of judgment to yourself.",Against,,"
